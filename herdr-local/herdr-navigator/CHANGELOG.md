# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Agent rows show the current terminal task when Herdr provides one, alongside fuzzy search and Preview support.
- Navigator-specific `[theme].name` and `[theme.custom]` overrides. Navigator layers inherited Herdr custom tokens beneath its own custom tokens ([#20](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/20)).

## [0.3.6] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- Allow newly created workspaces to use plain labels without the `dir:` / `project:` prefix.

### Fixed
- Agent terminal IDs remain searchable while focus actions continue to target pane IDs.
- Keep typing responsive on large indexes by resolving each entry's canonical path once instead of on every sort comparison, and by building the fuzzy matcher once per query instead of once per candidate ([#22](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/22)).
- Hide source-filter shortcuts for disabled sources.
- Always install the latest release when `F5` is pressed on the update badge.
- Restore focus to the picker-origin workspace after closing another workspace ([#16](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/16)).
- Suppress Herdr CLI JSON responses while closing a workspace so they cannot corrupt the picker render.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- Mouse wheel navigation, click-to-select, and click-again-to-open support in the TUI.
- `Ctrl-Backspace` deletes the last word of the query.

### Fixed
- Mouse hitboxes now start at the list's inner content row, accounting for the `Results` title instead of selecting the result below the cursor.
- Unbound `Ctrl`/`Alt` chords no longer insert their letter into the query; `Ctrl-Backspace` typed an `h` because terminals send it as `Ctrl-H`.
- Equal-score results now keep their source order (zoxide frecency, agent pane order) instead of sorting alphabetically.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- Apply one reusable Herdr Plus tabs/panes template to any zoxide/root directory with a configurable shortcut (`Alt-Enter` by default), creating the workspace or appending fresh template tabs when already open; `Enter` keeps normal behavior.
- Press `F5` on the update badge to confirm and install the available release through Herdr.

### Fixed
- Focus agent rows by Herdr pane ID, which `herdr agent focus` accepts, instead of unsupported terminal IDs ([#13](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/13), [#18](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/18)).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Inherit all 18 built-in themes from Herdr 0.7.4, including Dracula ([#3](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/3)).
- Preserve Herdr Plus `[[tabs.panes]]` splits, labels, and startup commands when opening projects from Navigator.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Notification audio modes: Herdr defaults, silent notifications, or an asynchronous custom audio file.
- A new full-width Navigator demo replaces the cropped preview.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** the plugin id, Cargo package/binary, action prefix, config directory, and release archives are now consistently named `herdr-navigator`. On first run, missing files are copied from the legacy `herdr-picker-plus` config directory without deleting the originals.

### Fixed
- Navigator notifications can now be disabled completely with `[notifications] enabled = false` ([#1](https://github.com/thanhdat77/herdr-navigator/issues/1)).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Non-blocking daily GitHub release checks show an `↑ vX.Y.Z available` header badge; `picker.check_updates = false` disables them and network failures stay silent.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Herdr-style source-aware result rows keep status/tab/pane metadata in a right column and expand only zoxide/root entries to a second full-path line; native `prefix+g` glyphs mark selection, focus, blocked, working, idle, done, and unknown states. `picker.detailed_rows = false` restores the compact list.
- Re-invoking the overlay `open` action focuses the existing Navigator in the current workspace instead of opening a duplicate pane.
- Herdr Navigator banner, social preview, and a shorter outcome-led README.
- Configurable Jump Back action (`herdr-picker-plus.jump-back`) toggles to the workspace left by the last successful local picker navigation and can pin that workspace first in the initial picker view.
- Persistent side pane mode: the `open-side` action opens the picker in a right split (like herdr-file-viewer). Launch-or-focus, toggles closed when already focused, and the picker stays open after `Enter`.
- `Ctrl-X` closes the selected/open matching workspace without closing the picker; the picker refuses to close its owning workspace.
- Built-in server/remote source from remote `[sessions.entries]`, using `herdr --remote TARGET --handoff`, plus local session entries from `herdr session list --json`.

### Changed
- User-facing name and GitHub repository are now Herdr Navigator; the stable `herdr-picker-plus` plugin id, binary, config path, and action prefix are unchanged.
- Agent source now uses the dedicated `herdr agent list` endpoint instead of filtering `herdr pane list`, and agents are searchable by their `agent_session` id.
- Workspace rows surface the workspace-level `agent_status` from `herdr workspace list` in the subtitle, and match `focused`/status search terms.
- Requires Herdr 0.7.3+ (`min_herdr_version` bumped for `agent list` and workspace `agent_status`).
- Empty default picker results now honor agent status priority when `agent_sort = "priority"` or Herdr `agent_panel_sort = "priority"` is active.
- Agent status priority is now: blocked/error/fail, attention/request/wait, done/complete, working/running, idle/unknown.
- Removed built-in SSH/server-terminal handling from Picker; `Ctrl-S` now hands off to Herdr remote servers.
- Picker footer uses compact Ctrl-style key hints.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Command/JSON plugin integration contract via `[[integrations]]`.
- Herdr success/error notifications for selected actions.
- Agent search by agent name, workspace/session label, cwd/path, status, ids, and aliases.
- Agent shortcut: `@` as a Ctrl-A-style full agent view with configurable sorting.
- Server source from `~/.ssh/config` and manual `[[servers.entries]]`, with `Ctrl-S` filtering and SSH connect inside a server workspace tab. This moved to the separate `herdr-server-aware` plugin after 0.2.0.

### Changed

- Agent rows stay tied to the pane start directory while still searching current foreground cwd.
- Herdr Plus logic now lives in a built-in integration adapter.
- Picker entries dispatch through actions instead of hardcoding behavior by source.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Show multiple open workspaces with the same cwd instead of deduping by path.
- Reuse project and directory workspaces by source kind so project and zoxide/root entries do not steal each other.


## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Herdr Plus Quick Actions launcher entry.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Herdr overlay picker plus.
- Sources for open workspaces, Herdr Plus projects, zoxide, configured roots, and agents.
- Configurable source order and search engine.
- Herdr theme-name inheritance with custom token overrides.
- Release and CI workflows for public builds.
